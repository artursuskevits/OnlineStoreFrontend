## Idea and Requirements Analysis
- Build an online store with robust functionality.
- Provide a convenient, user-friendly interface for purchasing a variety of products.
- Develop a scalable system capable of handling high traffic loads.

---

## Technical Analysis and Evaluation

### Backend
- ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)
- Entity Framework (Embedded database)

### Frontend
- Blazor Web App
- RESTful API
- Version control with GitHub

---

## Planning and Design
- Utilize Blazor for internal styling and create custom designs using Figma.

### Task Management
- Manage tasks, roles, and Scrum meetings using [JIRA](https://sigmakripery.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMDBiYzUyOWUwMTg4NGI2NGFkYTQxZGQwNmFiMWRmYjUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9).

---

## Development
- Code hosted and managed on GitHub.
- Regular commits with meaningful messages.
- Maintain clean, readable code with clear comments.

---

## Testing
Testing ensures that the application meets functional and non-functional requirements across different environments.

## Code Review

### General Feedback
1. **Repeated Logic**:
   - Duplicated logic exists across `CartsController` and `PaymentController`.
   - **Recommendation**: Extract shared functionality (e.g., retrieving a cart with its items) into a common service or private method.

2. **Logging**:
   - Logging is missing for error handling.
   - **Recommendation**: Use `ILogger` to track key events and issues.

3. **Security Issues**:
   - Passwords are stored without encryption. Use libraries like `Identity` or `BCrypt`.
   - No validation for user permissions to access sensitive resources.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Missing global exception handling middleware for unexpected issues.

### Controller-Specific Feedback

#### CartsController
**Positive Aspects**:
- Proper use of `Include` and `ThenInclude` to handle nested entities.
- Good checks for empty cart and stock availability.

**Recommendations**:
1. Use transactions for critical operations like stock updates during checkout.
2. Extract repeated logic (e.g., retrieving carts) into private methods.
3. Add validation annotations to DTOs like `CartItemDto`.

#### PaymentController
**Positive Aspects**:
- Validates stock availability during checkout.

**Recommendations**:
1. Remove inappropriate placeholders (e.g., `"denis loh suka"`).
2. Consolidate overlapping logic with `CartsController` into a shared service.
3. Replace string-based responses with structured objects for better readability.

#### ProductsController
**Positive Aspects**:
- Implements standard CRUD operations effectively.
- Validates product existence with `ProductExists`.

**Recommendations**:
1. Add `ModelState` validation before saving data.
2. Ensure consistent error handling across all methods.

#### UsersController
**Positive Aspects**:
- Implements basic user registration and login checks.
- Passwords are hashed before storage.

**Recommendations**:
1. Replace outdated password hashing (e.g., SHA256 without a salt) with secure libraries like `BCrypt`.
2. Avoid returning sensitive user data. Instead, return tokens or minimal information.
3. Move password-related logic into a separate service for better maintainability.
